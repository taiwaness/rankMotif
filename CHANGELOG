1.7  2014-05-13  Jian-Long Huang <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

	* Fix the bug of adding the matching information.

	* Fix the string consumption when scanning matched sequences
	for a pattern. The overlapping sites will be retained now.

1.6  2014-04-25  Jian-Long Huang <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

	* Add the positive set supports information for each
	cluster to 'cluster_support.txt'

1.5  2014-03-19  Jian-Long Haung <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

	* Add positive set support information to
	'merged_patterns' file.

1.4  2014-02-27  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

	* Enhancement of parsing conservation score file.
	When parsing the conservation score (-cs), if
	the score is a dash ('-'), that means it's value
	is NA and will be omitted.

	* Add positive set support information (number
	of genes with pattern existence / number of total genes)
	to 'clustered_patterns.txt' file.

1.3  2013-12-13  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

	* Add new options: -cs and -sc for conservation scoring.

	* Fix occupancy scoring.

	* Fix the seqid that affect the mi and occupancy scoring.

1.2b  2013-12-13  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

	* New option: applying nucleosome occupancy scores (-oc).

	* New options for PFM similarity calculation: -ws and -gc.

1.1  2013-12-08  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

        * Change the command-line arguments:
            (1) -cluster to -nc
            (2) -n to -np

        * New option: applying sequence mask (-seqmask).

1.0  2013-11-19  Jian-Long Huang  <jianlong@ntu.edu.tw>

        * Implement basic features.
